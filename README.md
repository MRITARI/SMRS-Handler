 # SMRS-Handler
 
 **Simple Multi Reverse Shell Handler** — a light, console-based reverse-shell manager and interactive listener written in Python 3.  
 Built by **MRITARI** — Version `1.0.0`
 
 > Lightweight tool to accept/manage multiple reverse shell connections, select a client, and interact with it from a single terminal. Intended for **authorized** testing and lab environments only.

 ## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Notice
 
 This tool can be used for offensive operations. Do **not** use it against networks, systems, or devices you do not own or for which you do not have explicit, written permission. Use only in your lab, on your machines, or within written scopes of authorized penetration tests. The author and this README **do not** condone illegal activity.

 ## Features
 
 - Listen for multiple reverse shell connections (TCP).
 - Auto-assign incremental client IDs.
 - Interactive console with:
   - `list` — view connected clients
   - `use <id>` — switch to a client to send commands
   - `helpsh` — prints a list of commonly used reverse-shell one-liners (displayed with syntax highlighting)
   - `help` — command list
   - `clear` / `cls` — clear screen + reprint banner
   - `exit` / `quit` — close connections and shut down
 - Per-client output handling: only output from the selected client is printed to your interactive shell.
 - Non-blocking handling of multiple clients via threads and queues.
 - Shell one-liners (Bash, Python, PowerShell, PHP, Perl, Ruby, Java, Netcat) included in code (printed by `helpsh`).

 ## Requirements
 
 - Python 3.8+ recommended
 - Modules:
   - `colorama`
   - `pygments`
 
 Install dependencies with pip:
 
 ```bash
 python3 -m pip install colorama pygments
 ```

 ## Typical workflow
 
 1. Start the listener on your lab machine: `python3 smrs.py`.
 2. From an authorized target (lab VM/device), run a reverse shell payload that connects back to your listener IP/PORT.
 3. When a client connects, you'll see a message like:
    ```
    [+] Client 1 connected from 10.0.0.12:56789
    [*] Auto-selected client 1
    ```
 4. Use `list` to view connected clients.
 5. Use `use <id>` to select a client if auto-selection didn't pick the one you want.
 6. Type shell commands and press Enter — commands are forwarded to the selected client, and output (from that client) appears in your console.
 7. Use `helpsh` to view the bundled one-liners (for convenience), but **do not** use them on targets you are not authorized to test.

 ## Commands
 
 - `list` — list current connections and which client is selected.
 - `use <id>` — switch to a client by its numeric ID.
 - `help` — display help menu.
 - `helpsh` — print reverse-shell one-liners (syntax highlighted).
 - `clear` / `cls` — clear console and reprint banner.
 - `exit` / `quit` — close all client sockets and exit.
 
 If you attempt to send a command with no client selected, you will receive a warning: `No client selected. Use 'use <id>' first.`
 
 ---
 
 ## Troubleshooting
 
 - **Nothing connects** — check:
   - Is the client payload pointing to the correct IP/port?
   - Is the listener bound on the correct interface (set `HOST` to `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces)?
   - Firewall/host rules blocking inbound connections?
 - **Client disconnects immediately** — check for:
   - Payload errors on the client side (wrong quoting, missing interpreter).
   - Network drops / NAT issues.
 - **Encoding issues / weird characters** — output is `decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')`; some binary or non-UTF8 data will be ignored or mangled.
 - **Permission issues binding to port < 1024** — use a higher port or run script with appropriate privileges.
 
 ---
 
 ## Security considerations
 
 - This tool accepts raw shell input/output over TCP. Do not expose it on untrusted networks or the public internet.
 - Consider running the listener inside an isolated environment (VM, container) and inside an isolated network segment when testing.

 ## Changing the IP/PORT
 
 At the top of the script:
 
 ```python
 IP = '10.0.0.5'      # used in the embedded payload templates
 HOST = '0.0.0.0'     # interface to bind the listener
 PORT = 4444          # listener port
 ```
 
 Save and restart the script after changes.
